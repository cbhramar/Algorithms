This is a problem on functions from {0,1,..,n-1} to itself. Let f be any such function. 
Consider the sequence f^0, f^1, f^2, ...., of such functions, where f^0 is the identity function, defined by 
f^0(x) = x for all 0 <= x < n, and f^i is defined by f^i(x) = f(f^{i-1}(x)). 
Since there are only finitely many such functions, this sequence has to repeat at some point. 
The problem is to compute the smallest values of i >= 0 and j > 0, for a given f, such that the function f^i equals the function f^{i+j}.

Suppose the numbers represent students in a class and f(x) denotes the closest friend of x in the class. 
It is required to select a subset R of students such that for every student x, at least one of x and f(x) belongs to R. 
In other words, if a student is not selected then her closest friend must be selected.
Given the function f, it is required to find the minimum number of students that must be selected, to satisfy this.
